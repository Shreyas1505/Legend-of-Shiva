### A text based java game that was submitted for my 'Programming Practices' module.

Description:

Legend Of Shiva is a text based adventure game based in India. You play as Norman Drake a treasure hunter. Norman has explored the world in search of exotic treasures, but he has never experienced the deadly forests of India. You are searching for the Legendary Trident of Shiva(a Hindu God). The quest to find the trident is not that easy, you have to navigate through old temples surrounded by tropical rainforests and filled with lethal monsters protecting the treasures stored in the Temples.

The player starts the game in a tropical rainforest in India. The player can navigate through several temples and rooms. While doing so the player can interact with the items and characters he encounters in these temples and rooms. Player can use commands like pick which adds items to the players inventory or kill which can kill monsters that are a threat to the player. These are just a few examples, the player can use many more commands.

Some commands only work on particular items or characters.For example: place command only works on serpent garland and silver crescent moon. To win the player has to satisfy the following conditions:

1. Pick up the Shiva Trident in the final Room
2. Kill the Protector
3. Escape
